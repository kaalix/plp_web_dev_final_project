## Project Overview

Xil'Art is a multi-page static website designed to serve as a digital storefront for a high-end African sewing business. It is built with clean HTML, modern CSS for styling, and a touch of JavaScript for interactivity. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Pages

The website consists of four main pages:

1.  **Home (`index.html`)**: The landing page that welcomes visitors with a compelling hero section. It provides an overview of the premium services offered and highlights the key features that set Xil'Art apart.
2.  **About (`about.html`)**: This page tells the story behind Xil'Art. It details the mission, showcases experience through statistics (years in business, happy clients), and explains the team's expertise in fabrics and tailoring.
3.  **Portfolio (`portfolio.html`)**: A visual gallery of the beautiful garments and creations made by Xil'Art. It features an interactive modal for viewing images up close.
4.  **Contact (`contact.html`)**: A page for users to get in touch. It includes a "Send a Message" form and detailed contact information, including address, phone numbers, email, and business hours.
